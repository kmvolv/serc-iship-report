\section{Conclusion}
\begin{FlushLeft}
Through my internship at SERC, I was able to contribute to making an array visualization package in the language of Elm. Through this package, the user can obtain the visualization of an array in SVG format.
The user is given liberty to add their own attributes to the module, and decide how that attribute affects the rendered output.

With the help of the projects carried out preceding the package, I was able to get a good understanding on how a package can be built from the ground up as well as to create custom attributes to make user-desired modifications to the output, as stated in the aforementioned paragraph.

Overall, I found this internship experience to be very worthwhile and I'm sure that I will be utilizing the skills and insights that I have learnt here in later stages of my career.
