\subsection{elm-array-view}
\\[0.1in]
\begin{itemize}
    \item Similar visualization modules can be created for other data structures such as stacks/queues/linked lists. 
    \item The user may be allowed to interact with the data structure by utilizing a model-view-update architecture, such as selection of single/multiple elements, popping the topmost element of a stack, and swapping two selected elements.
